**A guide on building up a first (wholesale) colocation presence.**


About seven years ago, I started writing a paper on things to look for as a customer building into their first wholesale datacenter, along with a few anecdotes, recommended parts etc. (I joked it would be a pop up book)

I've tweaked it over time, expanded sections, added the odd drawing, a few pictures etc. Now, as its taken a while, most companies might not come out of the cloud, but I wanted to finish it, and post it somewhere, so that it's out there and hopefully helps someone.

Feel free to message with suggestions, questions etc.  

**The main file is the "My first Colo" (either in PDF or DOC)**
